# Welcome to my ESLint Assignemnt
## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

The ESLint "semi" rule is important because it helps keep code looking the same and avoids problems caused by the way JavaScript automatically adds semicolons in some cases. When several people work together on code using tools like Git and GitHub, it's important that the code looks consistent. This makes it easier to read, review, and collaborate on. The "semi" rule in ESLint ensures that everyone follows the same style for using semicolons, whether they choose to use them or not. This consistency helps prevent confusion and errors when multiple people are working on the same code.
